# Cripsy UI
It's a Component Library, build with all love.
Cripsy UI is only build with HTML and CSS.
A component library is a cloud-based folder that
consists of all the designed/styled parts of a website or
piece of software. It helps designers to work in a consistent
way and becomes very time efficient when executed correctly.




## Advantages

obviously; instead of only combining parts, the designer is 
also able to customize or create new parts. You donâ€™t lose 
creativity by using a Component Library. It is true, however, 
that you trade in a bit of freedom for consistency and speed.
